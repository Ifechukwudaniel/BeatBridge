# BeatBridge

Inspiration Music connects people worldwide. Recognizing the power of this universal language and the crucial role fans play in an artist's journey, we created BeatBridge. We sought to empower fans to become active participants, not just passive listeners.

🎵 What it does BeatBridge allows fans to support their favorite artists directly. By engaging with music, sharing, and promoting it, fans earn tokens redeemable for exclusive rewards. It's a unique platform where every beat builds bridges between artists and fans\


💻 How we built it In our project, we leveraged the noir to veify off-chain data on-chain securely. The Spotify API allowed us to collect various user-related data (such as favorite songs, playlists, time spent on music, etc.), but this data inherently resided off-chain.


## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (v18 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/Ifechukwudaniel/BeatBridge.git
cd BeatBridge
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. Add Spotify Environment Variables:
   
To get NEXTAUTH_SECRET
To create a secret key, open your terminal, run the command below, and copy the value generated to the .env file.

``` openssl rand -base64 32 ```

```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=781ec8bfbbe3403d9c9acaa15699837b
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=723bfc611600444395db4ba9f7fd7e48
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=koCNMnSVyhNobUJEYrQ0ffiZb47bsn8XNzy3DhkFBrU=
```

5. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

## Deploying  Smart Contracts to a Live Network

Once you are ready to deploy your smart contracts, there are a few things you need to adjust.

1. Select the network

By default, `yarn deploy` will deploy the contract to the local network. You can change the defaultNetwork in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts.` You could also simply run `yarn deploy --network target_network` to deploy to another network.

Check the `hardhat.config.ts` for the networks that are pre-configured. You can also add other network settings to the `hardhat.config.ts file`. Here are the [Alchemy docs](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-add-alchemy-rpc-endpoints-to-metamask) for information on specific networks.

Example: To deploy the contract to the Sepolia network, run the command below:

```
yarn deploy --network sepolia
```

2. Generate a new account or add one to deploy the contract(s) from. Additionally you will need to add your Alchemy API key. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the required keys.

```
ALCHEMY_API_KEY="",
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=""
```

The deployer account is the account that will deploy your contracts. Additionally, the deployer account will be used to execute any function calls that are part of your deployment script.

You can generate a random account / private key with `yarn generate` or add the private key of your crypto wallet. `yarn generate` will create a random account and add the DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY to the .env file. You can check the generated account with `yarn account`.

3. Deploy your smart contract(s)

Run the command below to deploy the smart contract to the target network. Make sure to have some funds in your deployer account to pay for the transaction.

```
yarn deploy --network network_name
```

4. Verify your smart contract

You can verify your smart contract on Etherscan by running:

```
yarn verify --network network_name
```

## Deploying your NextJS App

**Hint**: We recommend connecting your GitHub repo to Vercel (through the Vercel UI) so it gets automatically deployed when pushing to `main`.

If you want to deploy directly from the CLI, run `yarn vercel` and follow the steps to deploy to Vercel. Once you log in (email, github, etc), the default options should work. It'll give you a public URL.

If you want to redeploy to the same production URL you can run `yarn vercel --prod`. If you omit the `--prod` flag it will deploy it to a preview/test URL.

**Make sure your `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` file has the values you need.**


## Disabling type and linting error checks

> **Hint**
> Typescript helps you catch errors at compile time, which can save time and improve code quality, but can be challenging for those who are new to the language or who are used to the more dynamic nature of JavaScript. Below are the steps to disable type & lint check at different levels

### Disabling commit checks

We run `pre-commit` [git hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) which lints the staged files and don't let you commit if there is an linting error.

To disable this, go to `.husky/pre-commit` file and comment out `yarn lint-staged --verbose`

```diff
- yarn lint-staged --verbose
+ # yarn lint-staged --verbose
```

### Deploying to Vercel without any checks

By default, Vercel runs types and lint checks before building your app. The deployment will fail if there are any types or lint errors.

To ignore these checks while deploying from the CLI, use:

```shell
yarn vercel:yolo
```

If your repo is connected to Vercel, you can set `NEXT_PUBLIC_IGNORE_BUILD_ERROR` to `true` in a [environment variable](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables).

### Disabling Github Workflow

We have github workflow setup checkout `.github/workflows/lint.yaml` which runs types and lint error checks every time code is **pushed** to `main` branch or **pull request** is made to `main` branch

To disable it, **delete `.github` directory**
